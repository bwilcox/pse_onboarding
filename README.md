# Welcome to Puppet
==============

## Congratulations on joining the team!

Hopefully you have settled in and are starting to get a taste for what Puppet is like.

We want to make you successful, and so have put together this training plan for you to make sure you have all the information & knowledge that you need.

This training plan will give you the foundational knowledge for you to be successful, but there are a wealth of resources and people within Puppet that you should use to really enhance your learning.

## Getting Started with your on-boarding

Firstly to make sure you know what activities we'd like you to complete and when, if the coloured bars on each task on your Trello board don't show a week number, then just click the coloured bar, and they will appear.

## Your Board

You will see on your board, 6 columns or **lists**, these are titled:

* Backlog
  * Things that need to be done. Usually this is loosely sorted by priority but  it should be reviewed at the beginning of each week when you take cards from the backlog and move them to the "This Week" column
* This Week
  * Move cards here at the beginning of the week and try to get them all completed by the end of the week. This is designed to get you familiar with scoping how long things will take and giving realistic estimates.
* In Progress
  * Things that are you **actively** working on. There should be not more than about three things in here at any one time since there's not much chance you can actively work on much more than that at any one time.
  * If you have done some work on something and plan time back to it later, it should go into the waiting column if you're waiting on someone before you can continue, or back into the backlog
* Waiting
  * Things you are waiting on others for. Each of these cards should have a comment with exactly what you are waiting on, and from whom so that you can easily remember to chase things up. Also add a comment any time you do chase things up so that you know if you've been remembering to do it.
  * This column is important for talking to your manager or mentor since you should be able to tell than at a glance whether there is anything blocking you
* Completed
  * Move things here once they are done
 * It's also a good idea to leave a comment about what you've completed and where it as in case someone asks for it later. For example on a card called "Complete X Homework" you might comment: "Done, stored here [link]"

Lists and Cards
-------

The backlog will be full of tasks or **cards** which are all the activities we'd like you to complete during your on-boarding. 

Each card has a **Week** or **Month** label to give you an idea when you should be undertaking the activity. For example, **Week 3** is your third week at Puppet. 

When you click into a card, you will get the description of the activity, plus additional information and links to help you complete it.

If at any point, you're unsure about anything, or if you just have a question, please reach out to your manager or one of you colleagues who will be more than happy to help out.
