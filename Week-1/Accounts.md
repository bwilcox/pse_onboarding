Top tip - Save all of your usernames, passwords, credit card details etc in 1Password. You'll accumulate a lot of them over your time in puppet.

## Accounts:

* AWS - should be provisioned for you in your Okta account. If it is not, please discuss this with IT during your IT Follow-up session (usually conducted on Wednesday of your first week)

* Salesforce - if you have no email with salesforce details and puppet.okta.com doesn't show a salesforce login, raise a ticket here. If you don't receive a response after a few days, ping Katie Granger on Email/slack or #help-salesforce Slack channel

* Concur - file ticket in the here under section "Expense" choose "Concur Expense Account".
